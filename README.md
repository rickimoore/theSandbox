# My Castles In The Sand

This repository contains code written in my spare time after work to sharpen my skills in the web3 space. In my quest for continuous learning I have decided to put to paper some of my ideas, learnings, and experiments.

The starting project examples include:

- English Auction Series
- On chain Greeting Messages

## Hardhat-Hackathon-Boilerplate

This project builds on top of the hardhat hackathon boilerplate and all basic start up can be found below.
